# Jay
`Sentients` `Human-Computer Relationships` `The Past & The Present meet/build/converse with, The Future`

A Specualtive Design project by Femke Kocken and M. Shahrom Ali, TAG Research Center, Concordia University, Montreal. 

Jay is a collection of chatbots, each associated with feelings that areÂ normal for us to experience throughout life with humans that have emotions and intentions, but not so much with the machines around us. 

Jay is a speculative design project that reflects back to us what it, in a way, means to be human. After-all, all the emotions that this seems to inspire in us are not for another human but for (in oversimplified terms) a math equation. So if you don't feel, if you do feel, and *what* you feel: all say something about you as a human, and maybe (we hope/speculate) about humanity.
